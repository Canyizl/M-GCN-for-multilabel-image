 Considering the hippocampal circuit and memory mechanism of human brain, a brain-inspired Memory Graph Convolutional Network (M-GCN) is proposed. M-GCN presents crucial short-term and long-term memory modules to interact attention and prior knowledge, learning complex semantic enhancement and suppression


### Running

You can run the "train" OR "test" independently if you do not need to train or visualize.

1. train：You can use to train your own dataset OR make some references :

   ```
   
   Train:
   python main.py -b 8 --data VOC2007 
   Test:
   python main.py -e --data VOC2007
   
   more control details in main.py "args".
   
   ```
   
   

2. test: I make some simple work for visualization and test. 

   The input is a single picture, and the visible.py will output the predicted class.

  ```

  Test:
  python visible.py

  ```



### Checkpoint

The "checkpoint/checkpoint_07.pth" is used for VOC2007 (num_classes = 20).
Please put the checkpoint in "./train/checkpoint/" OR "./test/checkpoint/"
